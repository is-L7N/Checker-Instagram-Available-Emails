# Checker-Instagram-Available-Emails

# How Work ?
When you bring an account like this : example@gmail.com
You go to Gmail and create a new account with the same email address that you brought
When you create the account, you go to Instagram and then to, “I forgot my password.” It will send you a password reset link. Click on it and the account will open with the same information that was printed in the terminal. 

# ```bash
pip install Topython ```
